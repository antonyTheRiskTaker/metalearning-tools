Take notes while reading a book. It makes you think and ask questions about
what you are reading. Here are some devices for how to be an active reader
during the 2nd level of reading (see Doren's "How to Read a Book?" - Ch. 5 How 
to be a demanding reader):

1. Underlining
2. Vertical lines at the margin
3. Star, asterisk, or other doodad at the margin
4. Numbers in the margin
5. Numbers of other pages in the margin
6. Circling of key words or phrases
7. Writing
