How to take lecture notes using Scott Young's flow-based notetaking (FBN)
method?

The point is to provide a surface for connecting and linking ideas as they are
reaching you. The goal is to "learn it once".

Steps to take:
1. Start by writing out major ideas. Facts, dates, details and descriptions are
   reduced to just a few words. No full sentences and lengthy paragraphs.
2. With an idea written down, draw a few arrows to connect it to other ideas.
   Represent the ideas as being interrelated components, not an ordered
   hierarchy of ideas.
3. FBN is often used with `metaphor`, `diagramming` and
   `information compression` to enhance understanding.

Since FBN allows you to understand lectures better by sacrificing readability
for the purpose of reviewing, here are two hybrid strategies based on the
original FBN:
- Flow-based afternotes (FBA)
- Flow-based commenting (FBC)
