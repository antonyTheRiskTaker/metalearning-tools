Take notes while reading a book. It makes you think and ask questions about
what you are reading. Here are some devices for how to be an active reader
during the 2nd level of reading (see Doren's "How to Read a Book?" - Ch. 5 How 
to be a demanding reader, p.48 - 51):

## Device 1: Underlining
Underline major points, important or forceful statements in a paragraph or
section.

## Device 2: Vertical lines at the margin
Used to put extra emphasis on already-underlined statements (see Device 1) or
to indicate a passage too long to be highlighted (serving the role as Device 1).

## 3. Star, asterisk, or other doodad at the margin
## 4. Numbers in the margin
## 5. Numbers of other pages in the margin
## 6. Circling of key words or phrases
## 7. Writing
